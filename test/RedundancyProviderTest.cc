  "ISTANBUL â€” Confronted with widespread protests two summers ago, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan ordered a harsh police crackdown and tarnished the demonstrators as traitors and spies. Faced with a corruption inquiry focused on his inner circle, he responded by purging the police and judiciary."
  "So when Mr. Erdogan, now president, suffered a stinging electoral defeat in June that left his party without a majority in Parliament and seemingly dashed his hopes of establishing an executive presidency, Turks were left wondering how he would respond."
  "Now many say they have their answer: a new war."
  "In resuming military operations against the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party, or P.K.K., analysts see a calculated strategy for Mr. Erdogan's Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party to regain its parliamentary majority in new elections."
  "Having already delayed the formation of a coalition government, analysts say, Mr. Erdogan is now buttressing his party's chances at winning new elections by appealing to Turkish nationalists opposed to self-determination for the Kurdish minority. Parallel to the military operations against the Kurds has been an effort to undermine the political side of the Kurdish movement, by associating it with the violence of the P.K.K., which has also seemed eager to return to fighting. The state battled the group for three decades at a cost of about 40,000 lives before a fragile peace process began in 2013."
  "The overall assumption is that President Erdogan wants to create the conditions so the result of June 7 can be overturned, so that he can run the country from the presidency, said Suat Kiniklioglu, a former lawmaker from Mr. Erdogan's party and the executive director of the Center for Strategic Communication, a research organization in Ankara."
  "Now a sharp critic of Mr. Erdogan, Mr. Kiniklioglu said, I think there is little debate among normal and sane people in Turkey that the war with the Kurds is being used as a tool to reverse the election defeat. The Justice and Development Party, known as the A.K.P., recently began conducting nationwide polls to see how it might fare in snap elections, which could be held as soon as November."
  "The outcome of these polls will be indicative of which direction they will go, Mr. Kiniklioglu said."
  "Many analysts say that after weeks of stalled coalition talks between the A.K.P. and three opposition parties, new elections are likely. And at a time of crisis, Turkish voters, experts say, could very well turn again to Mr. Erdogan and the A.K.P."
  "The results of a voter survey released Wednesday by a widely cited Turkish pollster found that Mr. Erdogan's party could regain a parliamentary majority if elections were held today."
